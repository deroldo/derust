# Changelog

All notable changes to `derust` are documented in this file.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- `tracex::init()` now also builds OTLP push pipelines for **metrics** and **logs**,
  reusing the same `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`/`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`/
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` env vars already used for traces. Opt-in by env
  detection only (no new Cargo feature): when those env vars are not set, behaviour is
  unchanged — no exporter is created, only a warning is logged. Coexists with the
  existing `metricx` Prometheus/StatsD pull path, which is unaffected.
- `tracex::init()`'s return type changes from the external `TracingGuard` (from
  `init-tracing-opentelemetry`) to a new `tracex::Guard`, which additionally flushes
  and shuts down the metrics/logs OTLP pipelines on `Drop`. The documented usage
  pattern (`let _guard = tracex::init()?;`) is unaffected.

### Notes

- Metrics instrumented via the `metrics` crate (used internally by `metricx`) are not
  automatically forwarded to the new OTLP `MeterProvider` — see
  `crates/derust/src/tracex/README.md` for details.
